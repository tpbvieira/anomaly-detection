 - The current version does not implement any model of protection agains fake time. We only have the key expiration period and store the key in a protected memory. It would be good if the log analysis can help to reveal this situation.
 - The dict attack can be efficient on a PIN or a PASSWORD. This cannot be done without client.
 - So your suggestion is git approach? Can you describe it in greater detail or provide some links so that I can see how it suits into the current client model and how it affects the security?
 - Actually, when I saw the proposed mobile device monitoring systems – they are all very simple, there is no correlation analysis, just the collection of data. So our point of efficiency can be:
First data analysis in the offline (which no one deals with)
First sophisticated correlation analysis on a mobile infrastructure
Analysis performed at a low computation cost (this point we will have to proof, just to check the time of operations on a mobile with the data analysis happening in the background)
 - I agree. Adaptability is a bit hard to proof with testing though, so I would suggest to analyze first 2-4 most basic scenarios and the points 1,3,4 on them.
 - I don’t know whether it can help, but th mobile client as well as desktop ui has its own browser, i.e. files are opened within the application. I will send you the link to the ui, to see how it works.
 - Thiago has to add the description of MOS technique

 - They wrote me that they are especially interested in the offline mode protection.
 - I am waiting the analysis of basic scenarios:
	1) A hacker - downloading and uploading a bulk of files
	2) A malicious user - using and old password and downloading a bulk of files.

	- ive worked with mapreduce/hadoop during my masters (http://repositorio.ufpe.br/bitstream/handle/123456789/12454/Disserta%C3%A7%C3%A3o%20Thiago%20Vieira.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y), so maybe i can contribute with the distributed processing architecture.
 - possibilidade de avaliar a escalabilidade do sistema proposto, em termo de quantidade de arquivos e usuários simultâneos
 - 2Thiago: i am waiting for your part, and also you can see how to incorporate statistics into the communication with server. We will keep the track of time both on server and the client in parallel. It is also important to finish your part soon as the developers of storgrid have already asked me about the offline protection concept, so if all is ready and even your code, we can have application very soon.
 - @Thiago: Please, try to complete this part Tanya asked as soon as possible so that we can let storgrid people work in parallel to us.
