Title
	A Distributed Tensor-based Approach for Multidimensional Dictionary Learning


Problem Formulation
	Dictionary Learning is a signal processing technique useful for sparse representation of signals throught the estimation of basis vectors and learning sparse representations of training data. The sparse representation in terms of such dictionaries has attracted increased interest for compressive sensing and in solving problems such as denoising, compression, classification, data decomposition, feature extraction and image processing.
	In some applications the data and its dictionary are multidimensional, e.g., when estimating jointly bahavior of users in social networks or when evaluating correlation between audio and video. Tensor-based algorithms for dictionary learning can improve the performance for cases of multidimensional and separable data, regarding the dictionary identification rating, the required number of training samples and iterations for the optimization problem


	There are very good approaches for bidimensional dictionary learning, but these methods does not perform well for multidimensional dictionary learning
	Methods for multidimensional dictionary learning require more processing time than bidimensional ones and are poor regarding scalability
	It is necessary to improve the processing time and scalability of Multidimensional Dictionary Learning, in order to be able to apply for big data problems
	The tensor dictionary learning algorithms are limited by a great amount of computation and convergence difficulties
