Title
	A Distributed Tensor-based Approach for Multidimensional Dictionary Learning

Problem Formulation
	Dictionary learning methods have been used to estimate the basis vectors and learn sparse representations of training data [REF]. Likewise, sparse representation in terms of such
dictionaries has attracted increased interest in solving imaging problems such
as denoising [14], deblurring [34], and restoration [36], in addition to solving
tomographic image reconstruction problems [39, 43].
	dictionary learning is very important. It has been shown that dictionary learning algorithms are able to estimate the basis vectors from a set of training samples. In some applications the dictionary is multidimensional, e.g., when estimating jointly azimuth and elevation in a 2-D direction of arrival (DOA) estimation context. Applications: Denoising, Compression, Classification, Data Decompositio and image processing.
	There are very good approaches for bidimensional dictionary learning, but these methods does not performs well for multidimensional dictionary learning
	Methods for multidimensional dictionary learning require more processing time than bidimensional ones and are poor regarding scalability
	It is necessary to improve the processing time and scalability of Multidimensional Dictionary Learning, in order to be able to apply for big data problems
	The tensor dictionary learning algorithms are limited by a great amount of computation and convergence difficulties
